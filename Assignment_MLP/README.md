This folder contains two files having the dataset. One is in the raw .txt format. sonar.txt has 60 columns and 208 rows. This is
the one we have used for training and testing purposes. We have also converted the first few rows and the Class column into 
a .csv file only for visualization purposes and for ease of viewing the datapoints. 

One IPython notebook called making_the_sonar_dataset.ipynb contains the code to convert a raw .txt file into a dataframe. This
file can be skipped as it does not have anything to do with the multi-layer perceptron code. 

The second IPython notebook called mlp_program.ipynb contains the code for the multi-layer perceptron from scratch. This is the 
more important file to view. Both the notebooks have been saved as .py files as well, so they can be directly downloaded and run.

Sonar_visualizations contains the visualizations of the training data, its possible to gauge the relationship between the attributes and the class through such visualizations.
